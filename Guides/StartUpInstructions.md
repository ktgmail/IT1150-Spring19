### Clone your GitHub repository
"Cloning" a repository means you are making a local copy on your computer.  If using a lab computer delete the folder once commits are made.

First change to the directory where you want to store a local copy of your source code files: Open a command prompt. Press the Windows key and search for "cmd". Press enter to open the command prompt. From here we'll enter command prompt calls to clone your repository.

Note: cloning will create a copy of your remote repository on your computer. It will create a folder with the same name as your repository.

First copy your repository URL. For example, our class repository has the URL: https://github.com/ktamerl4/IT1150-Spring19. I'll use this in place of your repository link for the following examples.

```
git clone https://github.com/ktamerl4/IT1150-Spring19
```
### Visual Studio Code
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Open the folder you cloned on the local drive (or jump drive)
